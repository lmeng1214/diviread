In light of recent events following the 2016 Trump vs Clinton election, and the (present at the time of writing) election of Trump vs Biden, it has become clear that there is inherent bias in many major news sources. There are only very few news sources that are truly unbiased.

What Diviread (or Polinews) tries to accomplish is to combat this issue by presenting both sides of an event. Currently, the news sources are manually separated; but future implementation may have AI/ML to determine the bias of a news source.
